# Weather Assistant Integration

## Overview

The Weather Assistant is now fully integrated into the Event Horizon Weather application. It provides an AI-powered conversational interface that analyzes weather data and provides insights and recommendations.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Floating Chat Interface
- **Location**: Bottom-right corner of the screen
- **Design**: Glassmorphism floating window with backdrop blur
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Auto-initialization**: Automatically analyzes weather data when available

### ðŸ’¬ Conversational AI
- **Context-aware**: Uses current weather data and location information
- **Real-time analysis**: Provides instant weather insights
- **Multi-turn conversations**: Maintains conversation history
- **Smart recommendations**: Offers practical advice based on weather conditions

### ðŸ”„ Automatic Weather Analysis
- **Auto-trigger**: When weather data is loaded, AI automatically provides initial analysis
- **Data integration**: Sends complete weather data to backend AI service
- **Location context**: Includes geographical information for better analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

#### FloatingWeatherAssistant.tsx
```typescript
interface FloatingWeatherAssistantProps {
  selectedLocation?: Location;
  weatherData?: WeatherApiResponse;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Floating button with smooth animations
- Expandable chat window (400px width, 500px height)
- Message history with user/AI distinction
- Real-time typing indicators
- Auto-scroll to latest messages
- Clear chat functionality

#### Integration with App.tsx
```typescript
<FloatingWeatherAssistant 
  selectedLocation={selectedLocation || undefined}
  weatherData={weatherData || undefined}
/>
```

### Backend Integration

#### API Endpoint
- **URL**: `/api/v1/weather/assistant`
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: None required
- **Rate Limiting**: Standard API limits apply

#### Request Format
```json
{
  "question": "What's the weather like today?",
  "location": {
    "lat": 25.0330,
    "lon": 121.5654
  },
  "weather_data": {
    "summary": { /* Weather summary data */ },
    "trendData": [ /* Historical trend data */ ]
  }
}
```

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the current weather data...",
  "sources": ["NASA Power API", "OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo"],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### AI Model Configuration

#### OpenAI Integration
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Max Tokens**: 1000
- **Temperature**: 0.6
- **System Prompt**: Weather analysis specialist

#### System Prompt
The AI is configured with a specialized system prompt that:
- Analyzes weather data in context of user activities
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Identifies main weather risks
- Uses encouraging but realistic tone
- Focuses on practical meaning rather than raw numbers

## Usage Flow

1. **User selects location** on the map
2. **Weather data loads** automatically
3. **AI assistant initializes** with weather analysis
4. **User can ask questions** about the weather
5. **AI provides context-aware answers** based on current data

## Example Conversations

### Initial Analysis
**AI**: "Based on the current weather data for your selected location, I can see that the average temperature is 28Â°C with a maximum of 32Â°C. The weather type is classified as 'Muggy' with 75% humidity. The biggest risk to watch out for is the high humidity combined with warm temperatures, which can make outdoor activities uncomfortable. I recommend staying hydrated and taking breaks in shaded areas if you plan to be outside for extended periods."

### User Questions
**User**: "Is it good weather for a beach day?"
**AI**: "Actually, the current conditions might not be ideal for a beach day. With 75% humidity and muggy conditions, you might feel quite uncomfortable in the sun. The high humidity can make it feel much hotter than the actual temperature. I'd suggest either going early in the morning when it's cooler, or choosing a day with lower humidity. If you do go, make sure to bring plenty of water and seek shade frequently."

## Error Handling

### Frontend
- Network errors are caught and displayed to user
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- Graceful fallback if AI service is unavailable

### Backend
- Input validation (question length, format)
- OpenAI API error handling
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error logging

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Override default API URL
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for AI functionality (backend)

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Uses `http://localhost:8000`
- **Production**: Uses `https://huei-ying-oh.zeabur.app`
- **Environment Variable**: Can override with `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Voice Input**: Add speech-to-text capabilities
2. **Weather Alerts**: Proactive notifications for severe weather
3. **Activity Recommendations**: Suggest activities based on weather
4. **Historical Comparisons**: Compare current weather to historical averages
5. **Multi-language Support**: Support for multiple languages
6. **Custom Prompts**: Allow users to customize AI behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI not responding**
   - Check if backend is running
   - Verify OpenAI API key is set
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Weather data not loading**
   - Ensure location is selected
   - Check API connection status
   - Verify date range is valid

3. **UI not displaying**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Clear browser cache

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Backend logs show API call details
- Network tab shows request/response data
